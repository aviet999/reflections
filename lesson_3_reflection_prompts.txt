When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are traveling or are collaborating with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because other people might update the online repository but you might not want those to automatically go the your local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks is the a clone of a repository that's only on Github. Clones is a clone of a repository present on a local location. Branches a where commits branch within a repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

So that when you travel you have the most recent commit to work with.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

You can all work together in the same area. It would be easier to see the changes by pointing at them and communicating, but it would be harder to have everyone come together with comflicting schedules and proximities.
