When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are traveling or are collaborating with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because other people might update the online repository but you might not want those to automatically go the your local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks is the a clone of a repository that's only on Github. Clones is a clone of a repository present on a local location. Branches a where commits branch within a repository.
